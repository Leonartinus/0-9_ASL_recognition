# 0-9_ASL_recognition

## Description
This is a project that can recognise the American Sign Language (ASL) numbers from 0 to 9. The cv2 library is applied to identify the position of the hand in the image and the label 21 points. The coordinates of the 21 points are returned. We use pytorch framework to build the neural network and use the coordinates with corresbonding number labels to train a neural network. The interpretation of the gesture can be displyed by using the neural network to prodict the label given the 21 coordinates.
